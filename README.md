# Australian-Federal-Election-2025

Polling and related analysis for the next Australian Federal Election.

The timing for the next Federal Election will be determined by the government, 
consistent with the rules in the Constitution and the Commonwealth Electoral 
Act of 1918 (as amended). Typically, governments prefer to hold the election 
for the House of Representatives at the same time as the half Senate election. 
The earliest date for a simultaneous House and half Senate election would be 
Saturday, 3 August 2024 and the latest possible date would be Saturday, 
17 May 2025.

If a legislative deadlock arises between the House and the Senate, the 
government may call a double dissolution election in the first two and 
a half years from when the House first met after the previous election. 
That means a double dissolution election cannot be announced after 
25 January 2025; however, the actual date of any double dissolution 
election could be after this date.
